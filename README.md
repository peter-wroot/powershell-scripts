## PowerShell Scripts

My collection of miscellaneous PowerShell scripts.

### Restart-VSSWriters.ps1

Gently persuade VSS writers into working again. Used mostly with servers running "Veeam Endpoint Backup" that occasionally fail to back up due to failing VSS writers. 

### TimeSync.ps1

A PowerShell script to re-sync a windows system's time. Run it as a scheduled task for systems that have issues keeping time.
